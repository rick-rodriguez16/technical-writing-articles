# Javascript .some() method

The `some()` method in Javascript is used to determine if there exists ==at least one== element in the array that satisfies a given condition by a provided callback function. If such an element exists, the method stops immeditately and returns true.  If such an element does not exist, the method will return false upon completion.

The syntax for the `some()` method is as follows:

| Method part | Description                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `myArray`   | is the array whose elements are being tested by the callback function  |
| `.some()`   | is the method used to apply the callback function to the `myArray` array |
| `callbackFunction` | is the function that is tested on each element of `myArray`. It should return `true` if an element passes the `callbackFunction` test, `false` otherwise. |
